# smartlearn
The SmartLearn project is a Dapp for providing free translations of top courses into various languages on the web. To keep this service free, a sustainable financial mechanism has been created using smart contracts based on the Ethereum blockchain, which addresses the needs of participating users while maintaining their anonymity.
## Usage
All the steps for installation, implementation, and execution of this project are fully explained below in 15 steps:

1. **Install MetaMask**: By visiting the [official MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/), you can add the MetaMask extension to the supported browsers listed on the site. We used the Chrome browser. After adding the MetaMask extension, it is necessary to either create a new wallet or connect an existing wallet to MetaMask.

2. **Install Node.js**: It is recommended to install NVM first to easily switch between different versions of Node.js if needed. For installing Node.js via NVM, execute the following commands:
    ```bash
    nvm install node
    nvm install 16.15.0
    nvm alias default 16.15.0
    ```

3. **Install NPM**: Along with the Node.js installation, the latest version of NPM will also be installed. To change to the required version, run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm install -g npm@7.6.0
    ```

4. **Install Truffle**: Run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm install -g truffle
    ```

5. **Install Ganache**: Run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm install -g ganache-cli
    ```

6. **Install Python and pip**: On UNIX-based operating systems, Python and pip are installed by default. You just need to check the installed versions.

7. **Clone the project**: First, Git needs to be installed on the system. Then, execute the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/imansdev/smartlearn.git
    ```

8. **Install server-side dependencies**: First, activate the Python virtual environment. To do so, navigate to the main project directory using:
    ```bash
    cd smartlearn
    source smartlearn-env/bin/activate
    ```
    After that, execute the following commands to install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install django
    pip install djangorestframework
    pip install django-cors-headers
    ```

9. **Run the Backend**: In the same terminal where the Python virtual environment is active, run the following commands:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

10. **Install client-side dependencies**: Open a new terminal and run the following commands:
    ```bash
    cd smartlearn
    cd smartlearn-front
    sudo npm install
    ```

11. **Install blockchain-side dependencies**: Open a new terminal and run the following commands:
    ```bash
    cd smartlearn
    cd smartcontract
    sudo npm install
    ```

12. **Run Ganache**: In the terminal used in step 11, run the following command:
    ```bash
    ganache-cli
    ```

13. **Connect the local Ganache network and MetaMask**: First, select the local network "Localhost 8545" from the list of networks (if it exists), or add a new network with the following details:
    - New RPC URL: `http://localhost:8545`
    - Chain ID: `1337`
    
    Then, choose the "Forgot Password" option, copy the Mnemonic generated by Ganache, and paste it into the wallet recovery page in MetaMask.

14. **Compile and Deploy the contract**: Open a new terminal and run the following commands:
    ```bash
    cd smartlearn
    cd smartcontract
    truffle migrate
    ```

15. **Run the Frontend**: In the terminal used in step 10, run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm run serve
    ```
